Things I learned/improved on this week
--------

* Cool skill one
> Though Project Zero helped, working on Project One really helped refresh me on many of the basics of writing code, and how to perform certain actions with it. 
> I feel I improved a lot there.

* Cool skill two
> I learned a lot about how to reduce numerical errors in code from the lecture on Friday, I didn't know that was an issue that potentially needs consideration.


Things that were particularly hard
------

> For me, the hardest thing was figuring out how to make the while loop in my code to get it to make iterations (for projectile motion). In the grand scheme
> of all there is that one can do with coding it is a pretty simple thing, but, escpecially after not having done one in a long time, it takes me a while to work out, > consulting my old notes and textbook to remind myself of simple things. But, ultimately, I figured it out, and it seems to be working.
